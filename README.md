Joining a Private Room Is As Simple As Writning This Code

The First Part Is The Room Name You Want To Join 
The Second Part Is The Max Players (Up To 100) 
The Last Part Is The Game Mode Dont Worry About It To Much Just Keep It In Shared

```Csharp
NexaVRManger.NexaRunner.ConnectToRoom("OverlayCS", 10, GameMode.Shared)
```
